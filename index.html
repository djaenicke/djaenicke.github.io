        <h2> About </h2>
          <p> I'm Devin Jaenicke. I'm an embedded software engineer with interests in controls, power electronics, IoT, and machine learning. While my title
              is software, I generally enjoy tinkering and building. Outside of work, I like to read, ride my bike, play video games, watch sports, and most importantly
              spend time with my wife.
          </p>
        <h2> Education </h2>
          <p> I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering Technology from Purdue University in 2015. Before I was even finished with undergrad, I 
              knew that I was interested in continuing my education. Due to a lack of graduate degree options in technology, I decided to pursue an engineering degree.
              This pursuit began in Fall of 2015 with taking Mathematics courses at Indiana University Kokomo. During this time, I applied for the Master of Science in
              in Mechanical Engineering program at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis. I was interested in studying control theory and had realized that most
              systems that are controlled require knowledge in basic mechanics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer. For this reason, I decided to pursue Mechanical Engineering
              with a primary focus in mechantronics and controls and a secondary focus in systems engineering.
